# USBabyNames
This is a project about US baby names. 
United States Social Security Administration (SSA) has made the dataset available on the frequency of baby names from 1880 to 2022.
From the dataset I analyze the following:
1) Analyzing Naming Trends.
2) Measuring the increase in naming diversity.
3) The "last letter" revolution.
4) Boy names that became girl names (and vice versa).
